        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            Millions of Americans suffer from pain and are often prescribed opioids to treat their conditions. 
            However, the dangers of prescription misuse, opioid use disorder, and overdose have been a growing problem 
            throughout the United States.Drug Overdose remains a major concern in United States. In <b> 2019, 70,630 </b> drug 
            overdose deaths occurred in the United States. Opioids currently are the main driver of drug overdose deaths. 
            This includes prescription opioids, synthetic opioids and heroin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this visualization is to explore the following question: 
            Which regions/states have been impacted the most by the opioid crisis/overdose deaths in the US during 2019?
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: 
            Data for the visualizations are from CDC.org primarily for the year 2019.
            User's can navigate through the slideshow by clicking the arrows on the left/right sides of the screen, 
            clicking the navigation dots on top, or using the left/right buttons on a keyboard.
            The decription for the graphs are provided in the section below the graph and can be seen by scrolling down/up.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div class="intro">
          <p>
            <strong>Narrative Structure</strong>
            The visualization follows an interactive slideshow that guides(author led) the user through various scenes.
            The introduction slides set the context around the nature of data and the introduction to the narrative visualization.
            In the main set of scenes, the first scene shows the region wise breakdown across the country(US) for the average number of deaths due to drug overdose in year 2019.
            There is an annotation in this scene that points to the region that has the highest number of deaths i.e North East
            The second slide shows a drill down and continuation from scene1 to get into the states for the top most region(i.e. NorthEast US)  that contribute to the highest deaths in US. 
            Similar to scene1 this scene also provides an annotation to highlight the State thats having the worst death rate compared to the rest in 2019.
            and the third slide gives the user ability(user-led scene) to interactively check /uncheck checkboxes for the region so that the user can understand the death rate acorss all states in US filterd by region.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scenes</strong>
            The first main slide with chart showcases the average deaths across various regions in US for 2019 showing an overview of the Drug Overdose within the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Annotations</strong>
            Slide 1 with chart also has an annotation that is meant to draw the user's attention to the area of the chart that highlights the 
            region impacted by the drug overdose problem.
            Slide 2 with chart provides a drill down into the states within the top most region "North East -US" with an annotation to highlight  the state("NY") with highest average deaths.
            This provides continuation from previous chart where the user is author-led to drill down to the states corresponding to the top region with deaths due to opioids.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Parameters</strong>
            Slide3 with Chart includes parameters (filters for region) that allow users to interact with the data via filtering.
            The scenes aims to answer a simple question and these parameters allow users  explore data in more detail.
            For example, California, Texas, Florida and Northeast states seem to have much more drug overdose deaths than other states.  When a
            particular region is selected, the scene changes to show the data for the corresponding states in the region.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Triggers</strong>
            Choosing different filters on charts 3 triggers changes to the parameters discussed above triggers the 
            charts with a different state level data corresponding to the filtered region to reflect the changes and show the relevant information just pertaining to the filters selected.

          <p>
           This chart shows that the number of opioid overdose deaths by each region for the year 2019.
           The regions are classified into 4 categories  - Northeast, South, West, Midwest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question this chart answers is - Which region in US has the most opioid crisis overdose related deaths ?
            This charts answers that most deaths due to the opioid overdose are from Northeast region compared to other regions as highlighted with an annotation pointing to top region by average overdose deaths.
            The data is just for year 2019

            This chart shows that average number of deaths per state that have happenned in the North East region in US that had the most deaths in the year 2019  
            New York had the worst death rate in all of the states categorized in North East region closely followed by Pennsylvania and New Jersey
          </p>
          <p>
            This chart ultimately answers the question -Which states in the US have the worst death rate due to Opioid crisis in the top affected region(North East) based on previous slide for continuity- 
            Based on the visualization(height of bars) its clear that not all states have high death rate in the given North East region. 
            The chart also throws light on Vermont that has the least deaths compared to rest of the states in the region as it has the least bar height.
            The top 3 states that have highest Opioid related deaths are Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey with New York(as annotated) taking the pole postition on a this grim metric so that the state officials can take necessary measures to control opioid access

            This chart shows the number of deaths across all the states in the US with an option to interactively filter the regions(checkboxes)
            This provides an option to drilldown to a specific region and understand the death rate comparison of different states within a region, or a combination of regions or all regions at state level based on the check/uncheck options user selects(user-led)
          </p>
          <p>
            This chart answers the question -what is the death rate across all states in the US?
            This chart allows the user to interactively understand the death rate by state using the filtering ooption on the region (checkboxes)
            
            Conclusion : Based on these all slides so far  it's clear that drug overdose problem has affected almost all the states of the US. 
            This illustrates what regions and states are affected the most/least and how many average deaths have occurred in each of these states/regions for the year 2019.
            This is an epidemic that needs to be addressed to avoid the raise in the overdose deaths especially in those regions and states where the impact is high.
            Practical application of this visualization is that its helpful to highlight the states that have high death rates need and to  show attention to control the opioid access to people in those states/regions.
